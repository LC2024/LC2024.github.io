In his well-known paper [4] Robert Solovay proved that the provability logic of $$\mathsf{PA}$$ is the Gödel-Löb logic $$\mathsf{GL}$$. Also in the same paper Solovay considered some set-theoretic interpretations of provability logic which lead to stronger provability logics.

Latter Japaridze [3] proved  arithmetical completeness theorem for the polymodal provability logic $$\mathsf{GLP}$$, where for a modernized version [2] of his result $$[n]\phi$$ is interpreted as "the sentence $$\phi$$ is provable in $$\mathsf{PA}$$ extended by all true $$\Pi_n$$-sentences." 

In our work [1] we investigated the set theoretic interpretation of $$[n]$$, where $$[n]\phi$$ mean "the sentence $$\phi$$ is true in all  $$\Sigma_{n+1}$$-correct transitive sets." Assuming Gödel's axiom $$V = L$$ we prove that the set of polymodal formulas valid under this interpretation is precisely the set of theorems of the logic $$\mathsf{GLP}.3$$. Here $$\mathsf{GLP}.3$$ is the extension of $$\mathsf{GLP}$$ by the axioms of linearity for all $$[n]$$. We also show that this result is not provable in $$\mathsf{ZFS}$$, so the hypothesis $$V = L$$ cannot be removed. 

As part of the proof, we derive the following purely modal-logical results which are of independent interest: the logic $$\mathsf{GLP}.3$$ coincides with the logic of closed substitutions of $$\mathsf{GLP}$$, and is the maximal normal extension of $$\mathsf{GLP}$$ that doesn't prove $$[n]\bot$$, for any $$n$$.
