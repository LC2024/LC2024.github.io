In this talk we present a study about closure ordinals of the modal $$\mu$$-calculus, i.e., modal logic extended with least and greatest fixed point operators.

We show that $$\omega^2$$ is a strict upper bound on the closure ordinals of the $$\Sigma$$-fragment of the modal $$\mu$$-calculus, i.e., formulas generated from closed $$\mu$$-calculus formulas and variables through the logical and modal operators, and the $$\mu$$ operator. This reproves and extends the claims in [1] concerning closure ordinals of the alternation-free fragment. The approach presented here develops a theory of ordinal annotations based on the notion of well-annotations previously introduced by Kozen [2]. By imposing minimality on the annotating ordinals we relate well-annotations to the existence of closure ordinals. The central argument involves a pumping lemma for well-annotations. Assuming the existence of a sufficiently 'large'  frame, repetition of annotated sets enables a transfinite series of substitutions, showing it possible to obtain a minimal well-annotation corresponding in size to an arbitrary countable ordinal, thereby refuting the existence of closure ordinals equal or greater than $$   \omega^2  $$.
