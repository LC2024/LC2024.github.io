I survey results --- recent as well as historical --- about the
equivalence or inequivalence of systems that could serve as the
foundation of mathematics. Throughout I focus on clarifying which
notion of equivalence is operative in the various results, in the hope
of arriving at a more clear sense of which notions are relevant in
mathematical practice.

The known results that I discuss include:

  -  Type theory is not equivalent to ZF set
  theory (Kemeny [6])
  -  No two extensions of ZF are bi-interpretable (Enyat
  [4], Friedman, Friere and Hamkins [5],
  Pakhomov, Visser)
  -  (B)ZF is equivalent to the elementary theory of the category
  of sets (Cole [3], Mitchell [7], Shulman
  [8])

I consider precise definitions of equivalence including:

  -  Mutual interpretability
  -  Bi-interpretability: both strict, and generalized
  -  Morita equivalence [1]
  -  Categorical equivalence [1]

While bi-interpretability is, according to Hamkins, the "gold
standard for equivalence", there remains some unclarity in its
definition --- in particular, in the definition of "translation" on
which bi-interpretability is built.

I show that two theories can be Morita equivalent without being
bi-interpretable, even under the most liberal interpretation of the
latter notion. This mismatch between Morita equivalence and
bi-interpretability raises a puzzle about the classical result
[2] that any theory formulated in many-sorted logic can be
replaced by an unsorted theory. While the result is true for Morita
equivalence for theories with finitely many sorts, it fails for
infinitely many sorts, and even more severely for
bi-interpretability. I attempt to bring order to this situation by
considering various definitions of a translation between theories, and
by comparing the resulting notion of equivalence with Morita
equivalence.
