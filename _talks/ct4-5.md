We provide a syntactical translation from poly-modal provability logic $$GLP$$ 
to the Gödel-Löb logic $$GL$$.  This translation has two parts: first we use a translation 
similar to the Beklemishev's translation [1] from $$GLP$$ to a subsytem $$J^-$$
of $$GLP$$, in which the monotonicity axiom $$[n] A\to[n+1] A$$ is replaced by 
$$[n] A\to [n+i] [n] A$$. 
Then we define a translation which makes  nested boxes ascending, 
i.e. if $$[n]$$ occurs inside some $$[m]$$, then $$n\geq m$$.

Finally we provide a simple Kripke-style semantics for 
$$J^-$$  which enables us to reprove arithmetical completeness of $$GLP$$.
