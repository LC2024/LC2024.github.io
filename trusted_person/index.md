## ASL Code of Conduct
### Welcoming Environment
It is the policy of the ASL that everyone participating in an ASL meeting or
other ASL-sponsored activity will enjoy a welcoming, inclusive environment that
is free from all forms of discrimination or harassment. The ASL is committed
to the promotion of equal treatment for all members and other participants, re-
gardless of race, color, gender, caste, religion, national origin, ethnicity, migrant
or indigenous status, socioeconomic status, political beliefs, sexual orientation,
gender identity or expression, disability, or any other quality unrelated to the
ASL’s scholarly function. Harassment of any kind represents misconduct that
undermines the integrity of the ASL. All ASL members and other participants
in ASL Meetings are expected to do their part to look out for each other, and
to act to ensure that everyone feels welcome. This policy is meant to cover
everyone connected with the ASL meeting, including, e.g., staff, exhibitors, ac-
companying persons, and online participants, as well as on-site participants,
invited speakers, and organizers.

See the ASL statements on inclusiveness and diversity, and on women in
logic at [https://aslonline.org/inclusiveness/](https://aslonline.org/inclusiveness/).

### Reporting Problem Behavior

All participants at ASL meetings are expected to try to prevent behavior
that works against establishing a respectful and welcoming environment for
all. However, incidents may occur that require action. At each meeting, there
is a designated “trusted person,” who is charged with hearing complaints of
discrimination or harassment, and helping to deal with them. The trusted
person conveys the complaint to the local organizers and, if appropriate, the
ASL officers. The trusted person follows up with the complainant(s) once the
organizers (and ASL officers) have decided how to address the problem. The
trusted person, and those to whom they report, will act with confidentiality,
avoid re-victimization, and respect the principle of not taking actions that go
beyond the wishes of the complainant(s).

If you are the target of some form of discrimination or harassment, or if you
witness inappropriate behavior directed at someone else, please report to the
trusted person, or, if you prefer, to the chair of the local organizing committee.
Reports can be about individual incidents or about patterns of behavior, or
organizational features that might be working against a welcoming environment.
These may occur not only at the (physical) meeting site, but also at online sites,
social events related to the meeting, etc.
