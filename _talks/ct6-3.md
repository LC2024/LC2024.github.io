In the realm of propositional proof complexity and bounded arithmetics, the notion of a pebble game gives us a neat way to analyze resolution proof system and $$T^{1}_{2}(R)$$.

In this talk, towards a deeper understanding of the method, we consider the relativized arithmetic $$I\Sigma_k(X)$$ ($$k \geq 1$$) and a game notion corresponding to it and reprove some classical results of ordinal analysis without cut-elimination for $$\omega$$-logic.
