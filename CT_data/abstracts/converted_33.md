Team semantics can be seen as a generalisation of Tarskian model theoretic semantics originally developed by Hodges in [1]. In recent work, see e.g. [3], team semantics have been developed for LTL, CTL and CTL*. Also, team semantics have been defined and studied for modal logic [2] and first order logic giving rise to dependence logic, independence logic and inclusion logic [5].

We define a team semantics for modal mu-calculus, show it enjoys the flatness property and aligns well with existing team temporal logics. The approach taken utilises team semantics for modal logic and involves an algebraic study of powerset structures in order to assign a reasonable team semantics to fixed-points [4].
