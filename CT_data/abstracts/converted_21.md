This is joint work with Alberto Marcone and Antonio Montalb\'an.
Finite Ramsey Theorem states that fixed $$n,m,k \in \mathbb{N}$$, there exists $$N \in \mathbb{N}$$ such that for each coloring of $$[N]^n$$ with $$k$$ colors, there is a homogeneous subset $$H$$ of $$N$$ of cardinality at least $$m$$.
Starting with the celebrated Paris-Harrington theorem, many Ramsey-like results obtained by replacing cardinality with different largeness notions have been studied. 
I will introduce the largeness notion defined by Ketonen and Solovay based on fundamental sequences of ordinals.
Then I will describe an alternative and more flexible largeness notion using blocks and barriers. 
Finally, I will talk about how the latter can be used to study a more general Ramsey-like result.
