Ackermann's $$\gamma$$, i.e., Disjunctive Syllogism, is the third rule of his system $$\Pi^{\prime}$$ (cf. [1]); B is Routley and Meyer's basic relevant logic (cf. [3]). Given a logic L, a _rule of proof_ is only applicable to premises which are L-theorems; a _rule of inference_ can be applicable to no matter what L-formulas.

In [2], it is shown how to add $$\gamma$$ to B if this logic is reinforced with the "Principle of Excluded Middle". The aim of this paper is to strengthen this result by indicating how $$\gamma$$ can be added to a certain weak restriction of B. Also, it will be discussed if $$\gamma$$ can be added as a rule of inference or only as a rule of proof.
