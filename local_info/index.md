## Coming to Gothenburg

- **by land:**
  The Gothenburg central train station and the Nils Ericson Terminalen, the long
  distance bus terminal of Gothenburg, are both located in the city center. Of
  special note is the night train connection from [Berlin, Germany to Malmö,
  Sweden](https://www.snalltaget.se/en/berlin), which runs regularly during the
  summer and is often not accounted for on other train operator's websites.
  From Malmö, there are many options for getting to Gothenburg by
  train or bus.

- **by water:**
  Stena Line operates two regular ferry lines to Gothenburg: from [Frederikshavn,
  Denmark](https://www.stenalinetravel.com/routes/frederikshavn-gothenburg) and
  [Kiel, Germany](https://www.stenalinetravel.com/routes/kiel-gothenburg). There
  are further ferry lines to other cities in the south of Sweden.
  Coming from central Europe,
  taking the ferry is usually less complicated and often faster than taking
  trains through Denmark.

- **by air:**
  The airport closest to Gothenburg is [Landvetter airport
  (GOT)](https://www.swedavia.com/landvetter/). We recommend using the shuttle
  service operated by the Vy bus company between the airport
  and the city center of Gothenburg. Tickets can be purchased
  [online]((https://www.flygbussarna.se/en/landvetter)) and in person at
  machines at the airport and at some bus stops. Note that a round-trip ticket
  is cheaper than two single trip tickets.

## Being in Gothenburg

Once arrived at Gothenburg, there are various things to keep in mind.

- The currency of Sweden is the Swedish kronor (SEK). Many Swedish businesses
  operate *cashless*, including most restaurants and local businesses. Rather
  than obtaining physical SEK, we thus recommend bringing a debit or credit card
  with favorable currency exchange conditions and paying everything by card.

- Gothenburg has a great public transport system, including the largest tram
  network in Northern Europe. All public transport in and around Gothenburg is
  operated by [Västtrafik](https://www.vasttrafik.se/en/). The easiest way of
  buying tickets is through the [Västtrafik To
  Go](https://www.vasttrafik.se/en/Tickets/more-about-tickets/vasttrafik-to-go/)
  mobile app or by [tapping your credit/debit card to the readers next to the
  doors](https://www.vasttrafik.se/en/Tickets/more-about-tickets/tap-payment/).
  The public transport of Gothenburg is separated into multiple zones.
  The A zone contains the Gothenburg city area, including the suburbs and
  most of the archipelago, and should thus cover almost all journeys.
  
- A cheaper option of transportation is the bicycle rental service [Styr & Ställ](https://styrochstall.se/en/).
  Subscribing for a month costs 90 SEK (less than the cost of three tram
  tickets). With the subscription, all rentals for less than 60 minutes are
  free. There is a bicycle parking next to the conference venue.
