While partial recursive functions are ubiquitous in programming,
proving results about their behavior using dependently typed proof assistants 
like Coq or Lean is not straightforward, as they typically require the totality of all functions.
In this talk, we present a new approach for defining and reasoning about 
potentially non-terminating functions in such systems, and a work-in-progress formalization 
of these methods in the Lean theorem prover.
Our framework, which is based on domain theory, 
allows one to embed such partial functions and constructs like `while` loops into proof assistants, 
maintaining one's ability to write proofs about them. 

At the same time, we introduce a domain-theoretical representation of coinductive types
and partial corecursive functions. 
This, together with convenient automations, provides an extension to Lean, whose native theory does 
not include such notions.
Furthermore, our representation allows one to also write corecursive functions 
that would normally not be accepted even in systems with built-in coinductives, like Coq, 
as they would violate a required guardedness condition 
(like the `mirror` function on infinitely deep trees), 
or they would need to be partial (like the `filter` function on streams).
