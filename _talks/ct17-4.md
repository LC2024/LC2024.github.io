Connexive logic has room for two pairs of universal and particular quantifiers: one pair, $$\forall$$ and $$\exists$$, are standard quantifiers; the other pair, $${A}$$ and $${E}$$, are unorthodox, but we argue, are well-motivated in the context of connexive logic. Both non-standard quantifiers have been introduced previously,

but in the context of connexive logic they have a natural semantic and proof-theoretic place, and plausible natural language readings. The result are logics which are negation inconsistent but non-trivial.
