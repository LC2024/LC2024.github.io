Given two theories $$U,V$$ with axiomsets that are polytime decidable so that $$U$$ interprets $$V$$ -- we write $$U\rhd V$$ -- we will define a theory $$V'$$ in the spirit of Feferman provability so that $$V'$$ is extensionally the same as $$V$$ and so that $$U\rhd V \to \Box_{ {\sf S}^1_2} (U\rhd V')$$ becomes a trivial matter. We apply this technique to prove the two hierarchies of principles from [1] to be arithmetically sound in any theory containing $${\sf S}^1_2$$.
