It is known that basic part of recursion theory, such as recursion theory, smn-theorem, recursion
theorem and normal form theorem can be  formalized in HA [2].

The aim of this talk is  to do recursion theory itself more in constructive mathematics.
One of the problem is the treatment of complements of sets of natural numbers over
intuitionistic logic.
In this talk, we adopt the notion of complemented sets by [1] and
try to develop degree theory.
