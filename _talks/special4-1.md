Natural language semantics uses many different kinds of objects, incl. individuals, prop- ositions, properties, situations, events, and kinds. Simple type theories tame this 'zoo' [1] by assuming only a small number of primitive objects (e.g. individuals, situations), and obtaining all other objects via constructions out of these primitives. By distinguishing subtypes (or sorts), these theories straightforwardly obtain more finely-grained types (e.g. concrete vs. abstract individuals), allowing them to explain selectional restrictions (e.g. _eat_ $$\{^{\checkmark}$$ _an apple_, $$^{\#}$$_an opinion_$$\}$$) (i). However, this strategy blocks an easy account of selectional flexibility (i.e. why some predicates accept different-type arguments; e.g. _remember_ $$\{$$_the girl_, _that she was dancing_$$\}$$) (ii) and of semantic relations bet- ween such arguments (e.g. why _remember that she $$\ldots$$_ entails _remember the girl_) (iii). 

My talk answers this challenge by unifying intuitively distinct 
types in a single higher-rank type, whose objects code the lower-type objects (see [2-4]). This unification allows the same-type interpretation of expressions from different grammatical categories, immediately explaining (ii) and -- through the internal structure of the new objects -- (iii). Selectional restrictions (see (i)) are explained through the particular lexical semantics of the embedding predicate and its interaction with the new, higher-type object.
