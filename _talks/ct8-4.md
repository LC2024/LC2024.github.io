In this talk,  we explore the question whether some notion
of logical pluralism can be motivated on behalf of the existence of non-classical algebra-valued models of ZF(C). We argue that we can derive two notions of pluralism: a goal-oriented pluralism and a proper pluralism.  The salient idea is that there exist several non-classical set theories that employ different underlying logics and which serve equally well for _one_
particular goal: providing a foundation for mathematics.We examine the resulting notion of pluralism and discuss several objections against our proposal such as meaning-variance and the classical meta-theory objection.
