Carnap [4] demonstrated that the usual axiomatisations of classical propositional and first-order logic fall short of 'fully formalising' these systems. In particular, while there is a tight correspondence between syntactic, proof-theoretic, and semantic, model-theoretic, explications of the notion of consequence for these systems, a similarly adequate correspondence between inferential and model-theoretic aspects of the meanings of their logical expressions is lacking. More precisely, Carnap showed that there is a significant mismatch between the intended model-theoretic values of the logical constants and the model-theoretic values actually determined by the usual rules of inference. The standard axiomatisations of classical propositional and first-order logic are, thus,  not **categorical** for the intended model-theoretic values of the logical constants of these systems. This is **Carnap's (categoricity) problem**.

**Carnap's problem** has significant repercussions for a range of projects and positions in the philosophy of logic, language and mathematics. Although Carnap's original considerations focused on classical propositional and first-order logic, its consequences have since been investigated for other classes of logical expressions, including intuitionistic connectives [1], modal operators [2], as well as generalized [3] and higher-order quantifiers [7]. Furthermore, a variety of different solution-strategies have been advanced in the literature: from modifying the language or format of the consequence relation [8,9], over re-interpretations of the notion of an inference rule [5,6], towards adopting additional constraints on the space of admissible meanings [1,3].

The goal of this talk is to survey these different solution-strategies with an eye towards their ability of solving **Carnap's problem** in full generality and their resulting conception of (logical) meaning. An interesting upshot of this investigation concerns the, sometimes implicitly, adopted meaning-theoretic constraints by different ways of resolving Carnapian underdetermination. Moreover, **Carnap's problem** raises interesting questions about what it takes to have **completely** grasped or characterised a logical notion, resembling a similar discussion in the philosophy of mathematics. This parallel will be explored further in the talk.
