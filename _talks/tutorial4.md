The notion of well quasi-order (WQO) is a natural generalization of
well-orders to partial orders. Simply put, a partial order is a WQO if it is
well-founded and all its antichains are finite. Several equivalent
characterizations of WQO show that the notion is actually quite robust.

In the 1960's Nash-Williams introduced a strengthening of WQO he called
better quasi-order (BQO). This was instrumental in Laver's 1971 proof of
Fraïssé's conjecture: the collection of countable linear orders is a WQO
under embeddability. In fact all proofs of Fraïssé's conjecture actually
establish Laver's stronger statement: countable linear orders are a BQO under
embeddability.

This survey assumes no previous knowledge of WQOs and BQOs: we will start
from the definitions and the basic characterizations, then move on to some
sample results. We will pay attention to the logic side of the theory,
looking at WQO and BQO theory from the viewpoint of ordinal analysis, reverse
mathematics and Weihrauch reducibility. For example, it turns out that many
proofs and proof techniques in this area require quite strong axioms.
