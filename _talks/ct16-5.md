Dialogical logic, originated in the work of Lorenzen and his student Lorenz [2,3], is an approach to logic in which the validity of a certain formula is defined as the existence of a winning strategy for a particular kind of turn-based two-players games.
In this talk we present the result from our recent paper making explicit the relationship between winning strategies for Lorenzen-style dialogical games and sequent calculus derivations [1]. 
We focus on three different classes of dialogical logic games for the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic, showing that winning strategies for such games naturally correspond to classes of derivations defined by uniformly restraining the rules of the sequent calculus.
