A general question in the model theory of arithmetic is:

> "for which theories $$S$$, $$T$$ and which $$n\in\mathbb N$$ is it true
> that every countable sufficiently saturated model of a theory $$S$$
> has a proper $$\Pi_n$$-elementary end extension
> to a model of a theory $$T$$?"

Efforts over the past four decades have revealed answers
 to this question for all the well-known theories in arithmetic,
  i.e., the $$\Sigma_m$$ induction schemes $$\mathrm I\Sigma_m$$ and
        the $$\Sigma_m$$ collection schemes $$\mathrm B\Sigma_m$$,
 **except** the following instance.

> Kaufmann [2] in the context of set theory; Clote [1]  
> "Is it true that, given any integer $$n\geqslant2$$,
> every countable model of $$\mathrm B\Sigma_n$$
> has a proper $$\Pi_n$$-elementary end extension
> to a model of $$\mathrm B\Sigma_{n-1}$$?"

We present a positive answer to the Kaufmann--Clote question.
The proof consists of a second-order ultrapower construction
 based on a low basis theorem. We will also include a survey on the answers related to the general question above.
