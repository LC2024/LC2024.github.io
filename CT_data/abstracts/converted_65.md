A quasi order $$Q$$ is called a $$\Delta^0_2$$-better quasi order if every $$\Delta^0_2$$ array into $$Q$$ is good. This notion plays an important role in Montalb\'an's proof of Fra\"iss\'e's conjecture, originally proved by Laver, in the system $$\Pi^1_1$$-CA$$_0$$. We show that the property of being $$\Delta^0_2$$-better quasi order can be characterized in terms of an appropriate class of ill founded labelled trees, and discuss that result in the context of reverse mathematics.
