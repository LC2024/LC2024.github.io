A system of linear equations over a ring $$R$$ is partition regular
if for any finite coloring of $$R$$, the system has a monochromatic
solution. In 1933, Rado [3] showed that an inhomogeneous system
is partition regular over $$\mathbb{Z}$$ if and only if it has a constant
solution. Following a similar approach, Byszewski and Krawczyk [1]
showed that the result holds over any integral domain. In 2018, following a different approach, Leader
and Russell [2] generalized this over any commutative ring $$R$$. We analyze
some of these combinatorial results from a computability-theoretic
point of view, starting with a theorem by Straus [4] used in the work
of [1] and [2] that generalizes an earlier result by Rado.
