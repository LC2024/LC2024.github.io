I will address the classification of different fragments of the Galvin-Prikry theorem, an infinite dimensional generalization of Ramsey's theorem, in terms of their uniform computational content (Weihrauch degree).
This work can be seen as a continuation of [1], which focused on the Weihrauch classification of functions related to the Nash-Williams theorem, i.e., the restriction of the Galvin-Prikry theorem to open sets.
We have shown that functions related to the Galvin-Prikry theorem for Borel sets of rank $$n$$ are strictly between the $$(n+1)$$-th and $$n$$-th iterate of the hyperjump operator $$\mathsf{HJ}$$, which corresponds to $$\Pi^1_1$$-$$\mathsf{CA}_0$$ in the Weihrauch lattice.
To establish this classification we obtain the following computability theoretic result (along the lines of [2] and [3]): a Turing jump ideal containing homogeneous sets for all $$\Delta^0_{n+1}(X)$$ sets must also contain $$\mathsf{HJ}^n(X)$$.
Similar results also hold for Borel sets of transfinite rank.
This is joint work with Alberto Marcone.
