The theory $$T$$ is said to be **$$\mathcal{T}$$-approximated,** or  **approximated by the family $$\mathcal{T}$$**, or a **pseudo-$$\mathcal{T}$$-theory,** if for any formula $$\varphi \in T$$ there exists $$T'\in \mathcal{T}$$ for which $$\varphi \in T'$$.


**Definition 2.** An infinite model $$\mathcal{M}$$ of a $$\mathcal{T}$$-approximated theory $$T$$ is called _disintegrated_ if it is a disjoint union of models, $$\mathcal{M}=\bigsqcup_{i\in \omega} \mathcal{M}_i$$, where $$\mathcal{M}_i$$ is finite (possibly either $$\omega$$-categorical or minimal). Otherwise, $$\mathcal{M}$$ is called _integrated_.

**Theorem.** Any disintegrated infinite model is pseudofinite.


**Theorem.** There is an integrated model, which is pseudofinite.
