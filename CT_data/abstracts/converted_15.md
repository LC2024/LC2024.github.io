The recent paper [1] considers countable groups as elements of a Polish space $$\mathcal{G}$$ which in fact is the closed subset of $$\omega^{\omega \times \omega}$$ (under the product topology) of all group operations on $$\omega$$.  
It is a Polish $$S_{\infty}$$-space and is 
called in [1] the space of **enumerated groups**. 
Any abstract property of groups, say $$P$$, naturally defines the invariant subset $$\mathcal{G}_P$$ of $$\mathcal{G}$$. 
Assuming that $$\mathcal{G}_P$$ is Polish it is studied in [1] when $$\mathcal{G}_P$$ has generic groups 
(i.e. a comeagre $$S_{\infty}$$-orbit).  
The main results of that paper state that there is no generic group in $$\mathcal{G}$$ and  moreover, when $$P$$ is the property of left orderability the space $$\mathcal{G}_P$$ does not have a generic group.   

A. Iwanow studied the problem of existence of generic objects in [2] in full generality. 
He introduced some general condition which is now called the weak amalgamation property (WAP, see [3])
and showed that it together with the joint embedding property characterizes the existence of generics.  

We demonstrate that the results of  [1] mentioned above can be deduces by an application of [2]. 
We also add some new important examples of this kind. 
For example we show that the subspaces of $$\mathcal{G}$$ corresponding to Burnside varieties of sufficiently large exponent do not have generic groups.  
Furthermore, we extend the approach of [1] to actions of groups on first-order  structures. 
In particular, we present a statement for actions on $$(\mathbb{Q},<)$$. 
We also demonstrate how [2] works in the contrary direction, i.e. for proving of existence of generics in some natural group varieties. 
For example we show that this is the case for some Burnside subvarieties of nilpotent groups.
