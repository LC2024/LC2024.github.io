We extend previous results [2] regarding the phase transition thresholds for Goodstein Sequences and Hydra Games to a more general setting. In both cases, we substitute the original successor function with the iterations of a strictly increasing primitive recursive function $$g$$ satisfying the condition $$g(x) \geq x+1$$; more precisely, the steps of the Hydra Game, originally of type $$\alpha_{f\!,i+1}= \alpha_{f\!,i}[1+f(i)]$$, are now of the form $$\alpha^{f\!,g}_{i+1}=\alpha^{f\!,g}_{i}[1+f(g^{i-1}(1))] $$, while the steps of Goodstein sequences are changed from $$m_{f\!,i+1}=m_{f\!,i}\left(1+f(i) \mapsto 1+f(i+1)\right) -1$$ to $$m^{f\!,g}_{i+1}=m^{f\!,g}_i\left(1+f(g^{i-1}(1)) \mapsto 1+f(g^{i}(1))\right) -1$$. The new phase transition thresholds incorporate the starting function $$g$$. These findings also allow a generalization of the phase transition threshold for Ackermannian functions [1] and fit within a rich literature regarding phase transitions in provability [3,4,5].
