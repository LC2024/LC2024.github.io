If you know what a supercompact cardinal is, there are many possibilities
that come to mind for what the phrase "$$\Sigma_2$$-supercompact" could mean.
Noting that $$\textrm{HOD}$$ is $$\Sigma_2$$-definable, it is natural to throw
$$\textrm{HOD}$$-supercompactness and supercompactness in $$\textrm{HOD}$$ into
this mix, particularly given the interest in large cardinals in $$\textrm{HOD}$$
arising from Woodin's $$\textrm{HOD}$$ conjecture.  
We report on joint work with Shoshana Friedman 
disentangling these various possibilities, 
in part building on work of Bea Adam-Day [1], with models separating 
examples of these variants that are inequivalent.
