From Tarski's 1929 proof of the decidability of the 
first-order theory of the field of real numbers and Robinson's 1949 proof 
of the complementary theorem that theory of the rational numbers is 
undecidable, the boundary between theories of fields with decidable or 
undecidable theories has remained unclear.  Many more examples are known on 
both sides of the divide.  Generally, the proofs mix ideas from logic, 
arithmetic, and geometry.  The notable test case of theory of the field of 
rational functions in one variable over the complex numbers was explicitly
raised in print in 1963 but remains open to this day.

I will discuss the history of this problem, will describe some recent work, and 
will explain why its resolution has been difficult.
