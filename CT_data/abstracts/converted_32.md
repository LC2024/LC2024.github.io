In [1], Kripke proposed to carry out his fixed-point semantics for truth over supervaluationist schemes in the style of [2]. Three schemes stood out, corresponding to different admissibility criteria for extensions of the truth predicate that are considered in the supervaluationist satisfaction relations: (1) the scheme **vb**, which considers extensions consistent with the original one; (2) the scheme **vc**, which considers consistent extensions more generally, and; (3) the scheme **mc**, which considers maximally consistent extensions. In [3], Cantini presented the axiomatic theory of truth **VF**, which happened to be sound with respect to the fixed points of Kripke's theory constructed over the scheme **vc**: that is, every classical fixed-point model for **vc** over the standard model of arithmetic $$\mathbb{N}$$ is also a model of **VF**. As [4] shows, this is the best one could hope for in relation to any of the supervaluationist schemes mentioned above---there is no sound theory satisfying the reverse implication. Furthermore, Cantini proved that **VF** is a remarkably strong theory from a proof-theoretic point of view, matching the strength of the impredicative theory **ID**$$_1$$.

In this paper, we complete the picture of axiomatic theories of supervaluationist truth, introducing two new theories that correspond---and are sound with respect---to the schemes **vb** and **mc**. In the case of the former scheme, we advance a theory that we call **VF**$$^-$$, and establish its proof-theoretic strength, which equals that of **VF**. 

The most substantial part of the paper, however, is dedicated to the theory which axiomatizes the fixed-point semantic theory over **mc**. We provide a proof-theoretic analysis of this theory, which we call **VFM**, in two stages. For the lower bound, we show that the theory can define Tarskian ramified truth predicates up to $$\varepsilon_0$$ ($$**RA**_{<\varepsilon_0}$$). For the upper bound, we provide a cut elimination argument formalized within the theory **ID**$$^*_1$$, which is known to be proof-theoretically equivalent to $$**RA**_{<\varepsilon_0}$$. Hence, we conclude that **VFM** is proof-theoretically much weaker than the rest of theories of the supervaluationist family, and indeed on a par with the well-known theory **KF**. 

Finally, we also introduce the schematic reflective closure of the theory **VFM**, as defined in [5]. We establish its consistency, and carry out the proof-theoretic analysis for this theory, which confirms that this schematic reflective closure as proof-theoretically strong as the theory $$**RA**_{<\Gamma_0}$$.

This is joint work with Daichi Hayashi.
