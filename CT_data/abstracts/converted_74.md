System R ("Relevance") is Anderson and Belnap's logic of relevant implication (cf. [1]); BM$$^{\text{d}}$$ is Sylvan and Plumwood's minimal De Morgan Logic (cf. [4]) plus the disjunctive metarule MR (cf. [2] and references therein). By ternary relational semantics (TRS), we refer to that defined by Routley and Meyer (cf. [3] and references therein).

As known, the spectrum of logics delimited by BM$$^{\text{d}}$$ and R consists solely of relevant logics in the sense that they enjoy the variable-sharing property.

The aim of this paper is to define TRS for some prominent logics in the aforesaid spectrum when they are supplemented with the (full) rule Disjunctive Syllogism.
