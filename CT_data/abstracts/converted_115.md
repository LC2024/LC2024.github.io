Within this line of research we aim at understanding how much of the second-order categoricity of various foundational theories (such as Peano Arithmetic, PA or Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, ZF) can be recovered in the first-order setting?  These considerations germinated in the introduction of the concept of internal categoricity of $$\text{PA}$$ in full second order logic by Hellman and Parsons, which was followed by Väänänen's introduction of the notion of internal categoricity of Peano Arithmetic and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in the context of Henkin models of second order logic in [6] and in joint work with Wong [5], and later in the context of first order logic, as in [8] and [7]. Internal categoricity has been substantially explored and debated in the philosophical literature, as witnessed by Button and Walsh's monograph [1], the recent monograph of Maddy and  Väänänen [4], and in the recent work of Fischer and Zicchetti [3].

In the talk we argue that the notion of internal categoricity is best seen as a property of schemes, i.e. first-order formulae with a second-order parameter which apply to (first-order) languages returning (first-order) theories. To wit, we prove that each sufficiently strong r.e. theory (in particular: each r.e. extension of PA or ZF) can be axiomatized by a scheme which is _not_ internally categorical. Secondly, we introduce a short hierarchy of categoricity-like notions for schemes which refine internal categoricity and are based on Enayat's notion of solidity ([2]). Using it we prove two general theorems on the preservation of the appropriate properties by adding the full comprehension and the minimality scheme. As a corollary we are able to derive in a uniform fashion the internal categoricity of the $$n$$-th order arithmetic and Burgess' extension of the untyped Kripke-Feferman truth theory, KF$$\mu$$.
