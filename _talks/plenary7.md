What can one prove in general about the algebraic relations between solutions of a differential equation? In this talk, we'll talk about recent work in this direction connecting the problem to group-theoretic conjectures. We'll also discuss the more general program of making quantitative several aspects of forking and indiscernible sequences. This work describes joint work with Rahim Moosa and Scott Mutchnik.
