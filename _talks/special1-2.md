In 2002 Zilber introduced the theory of a generic function on a field [4],
coinciding with the limit theory of generic polynomials from [2]. Axioma-
tized in first-order logic by a version of Schanuel property and existential closed-
ness, this theory turns out to be ω-stable. As shown by Wilkie [3] and
Koiran [1], one can explicitly construct such a generic function on the com-
plex plane in a form of a Taylor series, using the ideas behind Liouville numbers.


In this talk we look further into the properties of the theory of generic func-
tions. As the main result, we show that adding any of these generic functions
to the complex field gives an isomorphic structure, which ought to be quasimin-
imal, i.e. any definable subset has to be countable or cocountable. Thus we
obtain a non-trivial example of an entire function which keeps the complex field
quasiminimal.
