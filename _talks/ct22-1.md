Cyclic proof systems admit derivations whose underlying structures are finite
graphs rather than finite trees. Such proof systems are especially well-suited
to treating fixed points or (co-)inductively defined concepts. A key problem of
cyclic proof theory is proving the equivalence of cyclic and non-cyclic proof
systems for the same logic. The literature is the most developed for cyclic
proof systems of Peano arithmetic, for which three distinct approaches to
obtaining this equivalence are known: one based on the reverse mathematics of
$$\omega$$-automata theory [1,2], one based on infinite Ramsey
theory [3] and one based on 'unfolding' proofs to exhibit certain
structural properties [4]. In this talk, I will describe and compare
all three approaches, illustrating the breadth of methods being brought to bear
in cyclic proof theory.
